    "prompt": "Create a stunning Christmas ornament in a Classic Ball style, inspired by the person in the reference photo, rendered in a vibrant \"cartoon style, animated character, Disney-like\" illustration. Transform them into a charming 2D ornament design, featuring exaggerated features, big expressive eyes, and a cute cartoon demeanor. The character should be adorned with a Santa hat, waving cheerfully amidst a magical snowy winter landscape, with sparkling snowflakes gracefully falling around. \n\nEnsure the design has smooth cartoon lines with \"bold outlines\" and utilizes a \"saturated palette\" of festive colorsâ€”rich reds, lush greens, and sparkling whites. The composition should feature a \"professional Christmas ornament\" aesthetic with a clean circular or oval border, accentuated by a decorative cartoon edge, ensuring the ornament shape is clearly defined. The design must have \"crisp clean edges\" perfect for cutting out, making it die-cut ready, without any 3D depth or shadows, to maintain a simple flat ornament appearance.\n\nCapture the \"whimsical, family-friendly cartoon aesthetic,\" focusing on simplified details that embody the joy and spirit of Christmas. Achieve a high-resolution cartoon art quality, ensuring the image is suitable for professional printing and cutting. The ornament should evoke a sense of magic and joy, embodying the essence of the holiday season, without including any text, letters, words, or writing.",
